               pursuing a degree in Physics and Computer Science.
               On my free time, I love to code and learn about a variety of subjects such as investing
               and interesting scientific topics. I also love to listen to podcasts and audio books
               as I believe that consuming media by listening is a great way to pass time and learn about
               different subjects while doing something else. Feel free to look around!`
